# robotics
This work is based on my internship at Alfred Kearcher SE &Co. KG
 
In camera.cpp file, 3D vision sensors code is implemented for the extraction of data, processing data and also for the visualization in rviz.

Additionally, new features are implemented like cleaning and docking station in file cleaning.cpp (used as a template in real implementation) and docking_station.cpp

Finally, light control module prototype was implemented whch was used as a template in real implementation. It was implemented in the last day of work. So not properly optimized(like removal of unwanted for loops).

Code for straight move planner for the robot is not added in the repo(Because of company policy)

Aurcomarker detection code, where aurcomarkers are used as artificial landmarks for localization purpose.

I also contributed in integration of 2D Google SLAM Cartographer into autonomous mobile robot and extension of ROS-Vrep Simulation framework. 

Below one can see the robot on which I worked on.
