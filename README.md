# robotics
 
In camera.cpp file, 3D vision sensors code is implemented for the extraction of data, processing data and also for the visualization in rviz.

Additionally, new features are implemented like cleaning and docking station in file cleaning.cpp (used as a template in real implementation) and docking_station.cpp

Finally, light control module prototype was implemented whch was used as a template in real implementation. It was implemented in the last day of work. So not properly optimized(like removal of unwanted for loops).

Code for straight move planner for the robot is not added in the repo.

Aurcomaker detection code is not added, yet to add.
