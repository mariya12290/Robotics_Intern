In camera.cpp file, 3D vision sensors code is implemented for the extraction of data, processing data and also for the visualization in rviz.

Additionally, new features are implemented like cleaning and docking station in file cleaning.cpp (used as a template in real implementation) and docking_station.cpp

Finally, light control module prototype was implemented whch was used as a template in real implementation.
